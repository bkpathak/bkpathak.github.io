# About

---

Hi there,

I am Bijay K Pathak. I am passionate about Computer Science, building things using data (both small and big), machine learning and distributed computing. In my free time I am generally found reading books, playing soccer or trying to dive in Functional Programming.

This website is about cataloging my learning experience, reflecting on different topics that interests me and some time to rant about software development, programming and technology.

Feel free to find me elsewhere in the Internet.
